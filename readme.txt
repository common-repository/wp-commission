WP Commission is a simple, powerful tool for website owners to enhance commission revenue with Amazon. We help creators profit from quality content.

== Description ==
WP Commission helps WordPress blogs earn more through the Amazon Associates program by displaying beautiful carousels of product images for visitors to click on and by automatically tagging all Amazon links with an Amazon Associates tag to make sure no potential revenue is lost.

Including a carousel of recent items is as easy as using the `[wpcommission]` shortcode. This will render a carousel with high-definition product images, with each image pertaining to an Amazon link posted somewhere on the site. To add more, simply add a limit: `[wpcommission limit=15]`

WP Commission also supports pinned items, blacklisted items, named lists, and more features through a friendly and intuitive interface.

Use of WP Commission requires purchase of a license for a low price at [WP Commission](https://wpcommission.com). This fee helps cover the cost of running our servers in order to keep your site loading quickly and your carousels and product images up-to-date.

For all other questions, please refer to the [WP Commission website](https://wpcommission.com), especially the [FAQ](https://wpcommission.com/faq) and [documentation](https://wpcommission.com/documentation).
